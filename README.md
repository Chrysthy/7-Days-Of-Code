## Day One

<p>On the very first day, you'll see how what appears to be a simple detail can make all the difference in your code and bring the expected and correct result, or depending on how you implement the code, the same command can yield an unexpected result. On this day, you'll learn more about the 'if' statement and boolean operations within JavaScript.</p>
