<br>

### Day One

<p>On the very first day, you'll see how what appears to be a simple detail can make all the difference in your code and bring the expected and correct result, or depending on how you implement the code, the same command can yield an unexpected result. On this day, you'll learn more about the 'if' statement and boolean operations within JavaScript.</p>

### Day Two

<p>It's not only about conditions and boolean operations that a code thrives on, so on the second day of the programming logic challenge, you'll learn how to work with input capture and how to store this information in variables to use them during the execution of your program.</p>

### Day Three

<p>On this day, you'll bring together everything you've learned in the previous days to create a dynamic narrative. And to ensure that this story only ends when the person reading it wants it to, you'll need to add loops to perform a task repeatedly!</p>

### Day Four

<p>Since we're delving into games and narratives, how about creating a program to play against the computer? On your fourth day, you'll learn to work with randomness to create a game.</p>

### Day Five

<p>Lists are everywhere and they help us manage a large volume of information. It's very important that you know how to work with arrays, and we've prepared a special day just for that!</p>
